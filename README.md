A discord bot intended for a group of friends. Very easy to setup for your personal server as well

Features these so far,

        Help function to see all commands
        Blackjack
        Roulette
        Fake Stock Market
        A Wheel to time someone out for a random duration
        Lottery system
        Daily points
        Commands to run every so often for points
        Role Authenticated admin commands
        Tracking of users various information
        Crypto Mining
        Options Trading


For setup heres an example config.json
{
    "token": "1111",
    "guild_id": "5111",
    "target_member_id": "1111"
}

Token is your bots token, guild_id is the servers id, target_member_id is the target of the notifs commands. 

With config everything else should autogenerate on startup. (May have messed things up here and there.)
